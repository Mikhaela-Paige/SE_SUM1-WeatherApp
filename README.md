The Weather App is an application that allows users to select a main city within the UK or enter coordinates (of up to 4 decimal places) for their own location in order to return an overview of the current weather at the specified location.

### Purpose

The reason for creating this app is so that users can be provided with real-time weather information, including usable figures such as the “feel” of the temperature and not just the exact measurable temperature, which is not provided by simply looking up the weather forecast. This allows for:
- An accurate real-time weather reading
- A summary of the conditions in the user’s current area/destination
- Up to date information not retrieved from estimates as with most weather forecast apps
- More accurate information from which to dress/pack, as 15∘ that feels like 18∘ will require different attire than 15∘ that feels like 10∘.


## User Documentation

Software Requirements:
- Google Chrome

To access the Weather App, navigate to [https://weather-app-86b5.onrender.com/](https://weather-app-86b5.onrender.com/) on a Google Chrome browser.

From the home page, either select a main city from those provided on the dropdown list, or enter your own location by providing your latitude and longitude (up to 4 decimal places). The weather information for this area will then display at the bottom of the page.

From this point, you can either return to the home page by clicking the button displayed in the header, or repeat the previous step to display the weather information for another location.
